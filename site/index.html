<p>Ingrid Lunden, reporting for TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last week, ahead of WWDC, there was a ripple of news when Axios
<a href="https://www.axios.com/apple-music-executive-bozoma-saint-john-plans-to-leave-the-company-2430821417.html">discovered</a> that Bozoma Saint John ‚Äî one of the more noticeable
execs at the company for being a woman of color, who led an Apple
Music demo at the previous year‚Äôs WWDC to some acclaim ‚Äî was
leaving Apple. Now TechCrunch has learned where she‚Äôs landing:
she‚Äôs going to Uber.</p>

<p>We received the news via a tip, and have confirmed the appointment
through multiple sources at Uber. The company, we understand,
views the appointment as important in helping ‚Äúturn the tide on
recent issues.‚Äù</p>

<p>As for what role she will be taking, that‚Äôs something we‚Äôre still
trying to figure out. We understand that Uber will be making more
details public later. Saint John‚Äôs track record is in marketing ‚Äî
most recently at Apple but also with a long stint at Pepsi, among
other places.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did not see that one coming. Nice score for Uber.</p>

                <p class="meta">Wednesday, 07 June 2017 at 12:03 am</p>
                <p>Unhealthy introspection is a daily threat to our joy in Christ. Many of us tend to examine ourselves in a way that is excessive, inaccurate, and leads to discouragement.  </p>

    <p><em>I‚Äôm failing at everything. I don‚Äôt like the way God made me. The Lord is not helping me. My service is worthless. My gifting is useless. My growth is hopeless.</em></p>

    <p>Self-examining spiritual depression speaks a thousand lies. The gospel speaks a better word.</p>

    <p id="when-self-examination-is-evil" data-linkify="true" class="bold">When Self-Examination Is Evil</p>

    <p>God calls us to examine ourselves (2 Corinthians 13:5; Lamentations 3:40), but healthy self-examination is a difficult and dangerous duty. The flesh seizes self-examination as an opportunity to turn our thoughts against us. Introspection is deceptive because it often looks like we‚Äôre doing the right thing: we‚Äôre not indifferent to our sin ‚Äî we want to seek it out! But when that introspection makes us self-absorbed instead of Christ-absorbed, we undermine our faith. </p>

    <p>As Charles Spurgeon once said, ‚ÄúAny practice that detracts from faith is an evil practice, but especially that kind of self-examination which would take us away from the cross-foot proceeds in a wrong direction.‚Äù </p>

    <p>I am familiar with this evil ‚Äî the self-examination that lessens faith and leads away from the foot of the cross.  </p>

    <p>I was once in a prayer meeting with a group of pastors, and I spent the entire meeting thinking about myself and assessing my contributions. And because that apparently wasn‚Äôt enough self-absorption for one day, I left the meeting and spent the rest of the afternoon continuing the self-reflection: considering whether I shared too much or too little, wondering what others thought of me, examining my motives, and especially hoping I didn‚Äôt pray anything dumb or heretical. </p>

    <p id="when-it-s-dark-open-the-curtains" data-linkify="true" class="bold">When It‚Äôs Dark, Open the Curtains</p>

    <p>Thomas Chalmers, a Scottish church leader in the 19th century, knew that self-examination can be tiring and fruitless. He once compared self-examination to a dark room full of objects. We can‚Äôt see what is there because the room is pitch black. This darkness is the reason looking at ourselves is often so unfruitful.  </p>

    <p>How do we brighten the room? Not by straining our eyes or taking more time and effort to examine the darkness. We will never see ourselves clearly simply by focusing more intently on ourselves. </p>

    <p>Instead, Chalmers says we must to go to the window and open the curtains. Let the light of Christ break into the darkness of your soul. The sunlight in Chalmers‚Äôs image is the truth of God‚Äôs word: ‚ÄúIf we derive no good from the work of self-examination, because we find that all is confusion and mistiness within,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúthen let us go forth upon the truths which are without, and these will pour a flood of light into all the mazes and intricacies of the soul, and, at length, render that work easy, which before was impracticable.‚Äù </p>

    <p>If you are currently lost in the maze of introspective concerns, aware of the confusion and chaos within, and burdened by renegade self-reflection, the best thing you can do is soak in the sunshine of God‚Äôs truth. </p>

    <p>Go to the word, hear the voice of the Lord, and experience the flood of divine light pouring into your mind with clarity and comfort. The sunlight of the gospel of grace provides the necessary atmosphere for healthy self-examination.  </p>

    <p id="soak-in-gospel-sunlight" data-linkify="true" class="bold">Soak in Gospel Sunlight</p>

    <p>So, when we go to God‚Äôs word, what light does the gospel shed on the darkness of self-examination? </p>

    <p><strong>The gospel brings proportion to our examination.</strong></p>

    <p>As we learn to treasure Christ, we will spend far more time looking to Christ than to ourselves. We learn that we are not changed by beholding self, but by beholding Christ (2 Corinthians 3:18). Robert Murray M‚ÄôCheyne famously said, ‚ÄúFor every look at yourself, take ten looks at Christ.‚Äù     </p>

    <p><strong>The gospel brings pardon to our examination.</strong></p>

    <p>God knows the worst about you and loves you still. ‚ÄúHe does not deal with us according to our sins‚Äù (Psalm 103:10), and he promises that if we confess our sins, he will forgive us and cleanse us (1 John 1:9). Only when we are secure in the love of God for us in Christ are we empowered for self-examination that is humble, confident, and fruitful.</p>

    <p><strong>The gospel brings perception to our examination.</strong></p>

    <p>The most important things we need to know about ourselves are not found by looking inward, but by looking to Christ. In his death and resurrection, our identity comes into focus. We see how precious and honored we are in God‚Äôs sight, the seriousness of our sin, the glory of our new identity, and the future we have in Christ.    </p>

    <p><strong>The gospel brings power to our examination.</strong></p>

    <p>Grace transforms examination from a tyrant and a burden into a means of faith, love, and hope. Self-examination doesn‚Äôt have to be buckets of water thrown on the fires of our faith. Instead, it can be fuel. We can see where God is at work in us, and we can move forward with the confidence of knowing that he who began a good work in us will bring it to completion (Philippians 1:6).</p>

    <p>Is the gospel informing your self-reflection? Always look up before looking in. Never leave the foot of the cross. Welcome the sunlight, and watch the darkness scatter.</p>

            Sometimes it seems like everywhere I go, I hear people grumbling about others. Maybe it‚Äôs me. Maybe people consider me a fellow grumbler and are comfortable unburdening themselves in my presence. But I‚Äôm inclined to believe it‚Äôs actually all of us and we all find some kind of catharsis in complaining about people.

            The Bible has a lot to say about money, and for good reason. Money, we find, has a uniquely powerful way of exposing our hearts and displaying our priorities. Ultimately, we see that it comes down to a matter of loyalty: ‚ÄúNo one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money‚Äù (Matthew 6:24).

But it all comes down to what "work" <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=work&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web">means</a>. Google is playing <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/30/strategyTax.html">strategy tax</a> games with search. I no longer consider it authoritative. It misses too many things that are important for reasons that have nothing to do with their value as a search result. I'm bettting that DuckDuckGo has a stronger philosophy and even if they were not to last as long as Google they're still worth supporting.

                An idea. I sent this to my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/danmactough?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Dan MacTough</a> who wrote the <a href="https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser">FeedParser</a> package for Node that I use in <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a>. "How about a package that compiles XML text into a JavaScript  object exactly as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse">JSON.parse</a> does." I got this idea from reading promotional material for the <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a> project. One of their concerns is that XML parsing is too hard. Okay, that's feedback. I think they're right. So let's make it as easy. Easy is good. Why not?

                <p class="meta">Wednesday, 07 June 2017 at 02:31 am</p>
                <p>A Super Hero movie starring <i>The Leaders of the Free World, </i>led by Batman-like ex-POTUS *secret* superhero Barack Obama vs his nemesis, the evil super villain DJ "Donald" Trump, also known as El Presidente. His superpower is being a smooth-talking sales guy.</p>
<p>Obama's sidekicks include a Canadian Prime Minister whose superpower is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=crooning&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web">crooning</a> and flexing his muscles, doing pullups using only his left pinkie, and the German Chancellor who has a PhD in Physics. They are pictured below at Obama's Fortress of Solitude in the Bahamas or Bermuda or Bali (no one knows for sure).</p>

                <p>It's on display, irrefutable, so why aren't the press making more of it? It's huge news. </p>
<p>How is it irrefutable? He ignores acts of terrorism where the perp is Christian. Only Muslim terrorism matters. But the Christian kind is more terrifying here in the US. We breed <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2017/05/man_accused_in_max_attack_cont.html">deplorable</a> Christians here by the thousands.  </p>
<p>You know where racist presidents take us, right? If you don't name it, you let it develop in the dark. </p>

                <h3><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a040652">Is Facebook broken?</a></h3>
                <p class="meta">Tuesday, 06 June 2017 at 08:17 am</p>
                <p>A really good <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/04/when-you-look-into-the-news-feed-the-news-feed-looks-into-you/">piece</a> in TechCrunch, you should read it if you care about social networks, how we got to where we are, and how stuck they are, and how weird it's going to get. The last part is left to your imagination in TechCrunch. But it's what I find most interesting.</p>
<p>I'm indirectly quoted in the TechCrunch story. They point to Gruber's <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/06/fuck_facebook">piece</a> entitled <i>Fuck Facebook,</i> and it extensively quotes a <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/31.html#a110526">piece</a> I wrote that explains why I can't/won't point to blog posts on Facebook. I followed up to <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/03.html#a010637">say</a> I continue to use FB and hope they fix the problem and turn FB into a fantastic blogging surface that I can cross-post to from my blog.</p>
<p>I wasn't kidding. I really have no use for FB as a blogging platform as long as they shun the web that gave them life. It was the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=primordial+soup&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web">primordial soup</a> they emerged from. Without it, 11-year-old Zuck would have had no way to experiment with social nets. But now Facebook so obviously tries to keep the web out, but my writing depends on the ability to integrate the writing of the web. It's like programming without the ability to factor replicated code into subroutines. <i>In FB blogging you're starting from scratch every time. </i>Yet Zuck uses Facebook to communicate with his users. His posts never have links and no titles, no styling. Just huge numbers of long paragraphs one after the other. That's probably one of the reasons I never read his posts. Maybe his thinking doesn't build on other people's ideas either? I've never met Zuck. Maybe that tells you something. Do you think the Beatles met Chuck Berry? Weird example I know. :shrug:</p>
<p>Should we let the news orgs off the hook? Of course not. They're even worse than Facebook. At least FB lets us post as equals to Zuck. And that's meant some voices have gained traction on FB without approval of Zuck and Company. Examples are numerous. But the NYT? You have to belong to a very exclusive club to be invited to post on their site. You have to know someone. And they have to like you. And that keeps out the truly good ideas. I know that when I read the NYT. I am welcome to read, and to pay, but my ideas aren't good enough to appear alongside the writers of the NYT. So they're even more of a silo than FB. </p>
<p>I still want the web. Look at the post I wrote yesterday about <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/05.html#a080612">RSS-in-JSON</a>. I spent a lot of time thinking about it, preparing, reading background material. How sterile it would have been if I could only <i>mention</i> the work I learned from instead of giving you, the reader, who I respect, a chance to read for yourself. Maybe you'd come to a different conclusion? You have to know, after all these <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/10/07/20YearsOfBlogging.html">years</a>, that that's totally OK with me.</p>
<p>I want the web and Facebook won't give it to me. So I think now Facebook has a huge self-imposed limit to growth, just like the journalists. Eventually I believe they will pay for it. Yet the conventional wisdom in tech is that Facebook won, they killed the goose that gave them the golden egg. I wouldn't bet on it. </p>

                <h3><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a050640">Old School really worked</a></h3>
                <p class="meta">Tuesday, 06 June 2017 at 09:05 am</p>
                <p>I have to say my new <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22old+school%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web">blogging platform</a> has made a huge difference.</p>
<p>All the techniques of 20 years ago come right back. I feel in a way like I'm writing in the "pages" of HotWired. I feel a confidence I haven't had in a long time. </p>
<p>It was the right thing to do. Often software only feels that way before you use it. The really good stuff feels that way even after you've settled in.</p>
<p>Now there are things that aren't hooked in. And the Facebook and Twitter metadata don't work properly in this model. I hope they see that and realize we could do better. I can't change their software, only mine. </p>
<p>Seems that's true of people too btw. If you want change and you're waiting for other people to give it to you, look for ways you can change, and that will automatically make them change. It's powerful, but it's the harder of the two ways. </p>
