<p>My thanks to Field Notes for sponsoring this week’s DF feed (along with the display ad in the old Deck spot). Field Notes is offering two special kits for Father’s Day and they’re boxed up nice and ready to go. Each includes memo books, notebooks, and a hand-screened card. One features a matte, black Space Pen and the other, a fine, limited-edition, hand-crafted rollerball pen.</p>

<p>They’re available through Tuesday, 13 June, and for U.S. addresses will arrive at dad’s house just before Father’s Day. A fantastic product and a great gift. (I would tell you that I’m ordering one for my dad, but he reads Daring Fireball and that would spoil the surprise.)</p>

<p>Jason Snell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Users will be able to download full seasons, and the Podcasts app
will know if a podcast is intended to be listened to in
chronological order — “start at the first episode!” — or if it’s
more timely, where the most recent episode is the most important.</p>

<p>I’m excited by these changes because, yes, some of my podcasts are
seasonal and are best consumed from the first episode onward. I’ll
be adjusting my own podcast feeds to take advantage of Apple’s
extensions as soon as it makes sense to do so.</p>

<p>The other big news out of today’s session is for podcasters (and
presumably for podcast advertisers): Apple is opening up
in-episode analytics of podcasts. For the most part, podcasters
only really know when an episode’s MP3 file is downloaded. Beyond
that, we can’t really tell if anyone listens to an episode, or how
long they listen — only the apps know for sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m optimistic about Apple leading the way on these analytics, because they have a deserved reputation for respecting users’ privacy and no motivation to do anything intrusive.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@johnnylin/how-to-make-80-000-per-month-on-the-apple-app-store-bdb943862e88">Great investigative piece by Johnny Lin looking</a> into a top-10 highest grossing app named “Mobile protection :Clean &amp; Security VPN” (punctuation and grammatical errors <em>sic</em>), from a developer named Ngan Vo Thi Thuy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Full Virus, Malware scanner”: What? I’m pretty sure it’s
impossible for any app to scan my iPhone for viruses or malware,
since third party apps are sandboxed to their own data, but let’s
keep reading…</p>

<p>“You will pay $99.99 for a 7-day subscription”</p>

<p>Uhh… come again?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There should be <em>no</em> “virus and malware” scanners in the App Store. None. iOS does not need anti-virus software. The App Store sandboxing rules mean that anti-virus software couldn’t really do anything useful anyway. And by allowing them to be listed on the store, it creates the false impression that Apple thinks you <em>might</em> need anti-virus software.</p>

<p>But do-nothing anti-virus utilities that are scamming people into $100/week subscriptions? That’s downright criminal.</p>

<p>Lin shows that “Mobile protection :Clean &amp; Security VPN” is not alone. The productivity top-grossing list is riddled with similar scam apps. </p>

<p>Given how many legitimate developers are still having problems getting their apps approved due to seemingly capricious App Store reviewer decisions, it’s doubly outrageous that these apps have made their way onto the store in the first place. These are the <em>exact</em> sort of apps that the App Store review process should be primarily looking to block.</p>

<p>And there is no excuse for Apple not having flagged them after the fact, once they started generating significant revenue. It’s downright mind boggling that this horrendous “Mobile protection :Clean &amp; Security VPN” app made it all the way into the top 10 without getting flagged.</p>

<p>Based on Lin’s research, the pattern is simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a scammy utility app and get it into the store. Make it a free download with an expensive in-app subscription.</li>
<li>Bid on common keywords like “virus”, “VPN”, and “wi-fi”.</li>
<li>Get tens of thousands of downloads thanks to the top-of-results placement from the ad.</li>
<li>Spring the in-app subscription prompt on your users and make money with a response rate of even just a fraction of 1 percent.</li>
</ol>

<p>Apple needs to remove these apps from the App Store, and prevent such apps from getting into the store in the first place. They should reconsider the effects of allowing developers to buy their way to the top spot in search results. And they should police the top-grossing lists for apps that are pulling scams — the most important scams to catch are the successful ones.</p>

<p>Lastly, every single dollar these apps have generated should be refunded to the victims of these scams.</p>

  <p>With <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml">Core ML</a>, Apple has managed to achieve an equivalent of PDF

is not venturing into the business of training models (at least
not yet). Instead, they have rolled out a meticulously crafted red
carpet for models that are already trained. It’s a carpet that
deploys across their entire lineup of hardware.</p>

<p>As a business strategy, it’s shrewd. As a technical achievement,
it’s stunning. It moves complex machine learning technology within

<p>If it really turns out to be the PDF of machine learning, that’s quite an accomplishment.</p>

              <h3><a href="http://tracking.feedpress.it/link/10732/6001684">Worship in Your Waiting</a></h3>
              <p class="meta">Sunday, 11 June 2017 at 12:00 am</p>
              <p>Our daughter, like many sons and daughters, <em>loves</em> Christmas. One December, when she was three, she asked us if Christmas was here yet . . . every. single. day. “Just wait,” my husband and I would say. “It’s coming.” </p>

    <p>To her delight, we assembled and lit our Christmas tree early in the month. She went to bed eagerly that night. The next morning she ran downstairs, full of expectation and hope. The tree was dark and empty. Her face crumpled, and she turned to me with a wail, “I have <em>waited</em> and <em>waited</em> and Christmas is <em>not</em> coming!” I smiled, but she had my full sympathy. I have waited many a day, sometimes with hope, and sometimes not.</p>

    <p id="waiting-for-what-we-ll-be" data-linkify="true" class="bold">Waiting for What We’ll Be</p>

    <p>All of us spend most of our lives waiting, whether for “big” things like a job, a spouse, a baby, or healing, or something that feels “smaller,” like summer vacation or for little ones to grow to maturity. Waiting can be good, and hard, and it isn’t a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence. Often when we’ve received something big that we’ve waited for expectantly, we assume happiness will follow, and our desires will be permanently satisfied. Instead, we quickly find ourselves waiting for something else — and sometimes several things at once. </p>

    <p>Waiting is a standard part of life in a finite world. Regardless of whether our waiting feels easy or hard at the moment, how we wait is shaping the people we are becoming. Worship is essential to that wait because a Godward perspective helps us to persevere with patience and hope. Endurance, Paul tells us, “produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us” (Romans 5:4–5).</p>

    <p id="worshipful-waiting" data-linkify="true" class="bold">Worshipful Waiting</p>

    <p>If we long for the endurance that produces character and leads us to <em>hope</em>, we must be fueled by Godward <em>worship</em>. Psalm 27 illustrates this principle in action so beautifully. Though the psalm opens with the confident question, “Whom shall I fear?” we find that the psalmist actually has much to fear, as he waits in a seemingly endless season for deliverance. He faces evildoers, adversaries, and foes (Psalm 27:2), an army encamped against him in a rising battle (Psalm 27:3), and enemies all around him (Psalm 27:6). </p>

    <p>In our waiting, fear longs to ensnare us, replacing faith in our hearts. The psalmist feels the oppressive nature of this temptation; he is not blind to what assails him in his wait.</p>

    <p>And yet his eyes can see more than the distressing nature of his circumstances, and worship makes all the difference — such a difference, in fact, that the psalmist requests that God might let him “dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple” (Psalm 27:4). </p>

    <p>His time of worship in God’s dwelling place is so powerful that he leaves enraptured with God’s beauty (Psalm 27:4), reminded of God’s promise to be a refuge for those who fear him (Psalm 27:5), to answer the prayers of those who cry out to him (Psalm 27:7), and to not forsake those he has committed to save (Psalm 27:9–10). This time of worship is so eye-opening, spiritually speaking, that he proclaims joyfully in the midst of all his trouble, “And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to the Lord” (Psalm 27:6).</p>

    <p>The end result of his worship is courage and confidence in the Lord — and a willingness to wait for God’s deliverance, and to wait with hope. “I believe that I shall look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living! Wait for the Lord; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the Lord!” (Psalm 27:13–14). The psalmist exhorts those around him with renewed trust in God’s character, promises, and even timing.</p>

    <p id="what-we-really-need" data-linkify="true" class="bold">What We Really Need</p>

    <p>You see, what my daughter needed most that morning wasn’t a Christmas tree loaded with presents. The fact that we had taken the time to set the tree up and adorn it, not to mention our track record of trustworthiness in general, could help her recall what was true of us in that moment when she could barely wait for what she dearly wanted. What she needed most was to <em>trust</em> us, our character and our promises. And that is what God’s children need, too, in moments of waiting: to recall who he is, what he has done, and what he has promised to do. </p>

    <p>During worship, God opens our eyes so that we are able to see him — to see all the resources available to us in Christ. We have been bought by his blood. He has us, and he will not let us go. During our times of waiting, let us not look to false saviors, but rather to our good Father whose heavenly host surrounds us every moment, even while we wait and wait. </p>

    <p>When, in our worship, we catch a bigger vision of the strong and kind heart of our God, then we are well prepared for the waiting that lies before us as long as we live on this earth. We will not stagnate in our waiting, but grow, and be blessed by it. In corporate worship, as we turn our eyes heavenward, we wait together for the one we long for most: our God who brings salvation (Hebrews 9:28). This is a hope that will not disappoint. When the waiting is over, we will worship the one who fulfills our expectations beyond what we could imagine.</p>

              <h3><a href="http://tracking.feedpress.it/link/10732/5996797">One Less Orphan</a></h3>
              <p class="meta">Saturday, 10 June 2017 at 02:02 pm</p>
              <p>Orphan care is far bigger than adoption. If the church is going to care for the fatherless, we eventually will find our way upstream into broken families to fight sin at the headwaters.</p>

    <p>Orphan care has been the topic of many conversations within the local church over the last decade. By God’s grace, many families and churches have stepped into ministries of foster care and adoption. Foster care and adoption captured our own hearts as we prayed about how we might grow our family.</p>

    <p>Of course, like many Christians, when we thought about orphan care, we immediately thought of James 1:27, the command for Christians “to visit orphans and widows in their affliction.” Often when the topic of orphan care comes up in Christian circles, it’s not too long before this verse is on the table. Praise God that many people today are aware of, and passionate about, orphan care. But in recent years, we began to learn of situations that challenged how we had grown to apply James’s familiar command.</p>

    <p id="bigger-than-adopting" data-linkify="true" class="bold">Bigger Than Adopting</p>

    <p>We were foster parents to a three-month-old baby girl, excited to welcome this little one into our home and shower her with love. We changed diapers, did middle-of-the-night feedings, and adjusted our other three children around the schedule of this new addition.</p>

    <p>When we began to consider adopting this baby girl, however, we discovered that she had a biological grandmother living a few states away who was interested in adopting her, despite some significant financial and bureaucratic hurdles. As we began what became a yearlong process of trying to support our foster daughter moving to her grandmother’s house, we started to realize that foster care and adoption were not the only needed ministries for orphan care.</p>

    <p>For many, the practical application of James 1:27 is to call individual couples and families to foster and adopt individual children. This is good, but it doesn’t meet every need. If James 1:27 is calling us to look after the vulnerable children suffering in our midst, it requires thinking not only about the children, but also the families and communities these children come from. It challenges us to consider not just the adopting of children, but also the reconciling of children to their original biological families when possible. </p>

    <p>For this to happen, orphan care needs to grow in a theology that encompasses the entire gospel story. Christian orphan care reflects the major beats of this gospel — creation, sin, redemption, restoration — and the major themes of the gospel story: themes like grace, justice, reconciliation, and adoption. These major beats and themes then influence our priorities as we consider how best to care for the vulnerable children in our communities.</p>

    <p id="mercy-upstream" data-linkify="true" class="bold">Mercy Upstream</p>

    <p>A theology that includes the full biblical story will recognize that sin — and the brokenness that results from sin — operates not only at the individual level, but also at family, social, institutional, and cultural levels. If we are to be faithful in the battle against sin, it will mean making it more than just a personal fight. It will also mean marshaling our resources to confront sin at every level.</p>

    <p>In the case of orphan care, this will mean looking upstream to the sources of sin and brokenness that lead to a child needing to be fostered or adopted. In our own situation, we found systemic challenges to getting our little girl to her grandma within a reasonable time frame.</p>

    <p>Since then we have worked with other mothers who have fulfilled all the steps necessary to have their children returned to them, only to see the courts cancel appointments due to backlogged cases. Their children languish in the system months (even years) longer than necessary. We have seen mothers handcuffed by immigration status, at risk of losing their children permanently due to the extra challenges of finding work.</p>

    <p>Orphan care requires more than middle-class families welcoming children into our own homes. Foster care and adoption are relief work — good and beautiful relief for a child from the brokenness of this world. But orphan care will involve more than just relief. It also includes seeking restoration and equity. It involves engaging in broken child-welfare systems and looking to prevent child abuse by walking with those who are isolated and battling poverty and addictions.  </p>

    <p>Reconciliation is at the heart of the good news of the gospel — in particular reconciliation between God and the people he created. In Christ, God moves toward us in grace so that ultimately he might bring us into fellowship with him.</p>

    <p>The fact that reconciliation is a major theme of the gospel storyline will soon make us realize that as much as we still need to foster and adopt, we can do even more to promote biological families staying together. Families reconciling and reuniting is one of the ways we “echo” the gospel and thus bear witness to the God who is reconciling an entire people to himself.</p>

    <p id="the-savior-we-really-need" data-linkify="true" class="bold">The Savior We Really Need</p>

    <p>This side of heaven, we will always have need to foster and adopt children. But the message of the gospel also motivates the wider community of believers to go to the most broken and isolated family units and share the good news that, in Jesus, all things can be made new. It also inspires members to leverage their vocations, legal skills, and political advocacy to shed light on systems and structures within the child-welfare system that are suffering from the decay of sin, and in ways that perpetuate injustice and harm biological families.</p>

    <p>As we built a relationship with the grandmother of our foster girl, we began to see and grieve the brokenness that came from generations of both systemic and individual sin: brokenness that led to the mess that this girl and her grandmother found themselves in, and brokenness within the government system that added unnecessary burdens to an already painful situation.</p>

    <p>But we were also able to step into their mess and be present with them in their suffering. By God’s grace, we were able to walk with them over the course of a year, to the point where this grandmother, at long last, was able to adopt her granddaughter. One less orphan. </p>

    <p>It can be easy to welcome foster children into our homes as though we are their saviors. But that’s not what God calls us to when he tells us to care for orphans. Instead, God calls us to point the vulnerable, the suffering, and the broken to the only Lord and Savior everyone in our world needs.</p>

              <h3><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a110653">How Frontier is better than Node</a></h3>
              <p class="meta">Saturday, 10 June 2017 at 03:54 pm</p>
              <p>I just had to write some complex code in Node that would have been easier to write in Frontier. It had to suck in a calendar-structured folder of archived HTML text into a data structure that roughly parallels the folder structure. Frontier makes this easier in several ways:</p>
<p>1. It's synchronous. But then so is Node if you want it to be and for this application I used the synchronous version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readdirsync_path_options">fs</a> routines. To do it asynch would have taken hours. And since this is code that runs at startup, who cares if it hogs the CPU. It runs once and that's it.</p>
<p>2. Frontier has a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/frontier/blob/master/Common/source/fileloop.c">fileloop</a> construct that does all the stuff you have to do explicitly in JS, baked into its kernel. A time and complexity saver. </p>
<p>3. By far the most important thing is Frontier's integrated debugger. I would use the debugger to write the code. Using it to be sure what values were in what variables to save me the time of having to figure it out. People who haven't worked in an environment where the debgger and editor are the same thing wouldn't understand this. It's the one thing I miss the most. (Node does have a debugger and I use it. I write sloppy first versions so I can get to that point of letting the code speak for itself at runtime.)</p>
<p>I often skip over these observations because I am deep in codewriting mode when they occur to me. This time I popped out and wrote it down. A testimony to the value of having a blogging system that excels at quick writing and no production work to publish. </p>

              <h3><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a090634">The Democratic Party needs to grok advertising</a></h3>
              <p class="meta">Saturday, 10 June 2017 at 01:56 pm</p>
              <p>Lately I've been watching a lot of MSNBC. </p>
<p>Commercials for all kinds of stuff. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg_rRI76KdM">Ambulance</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvKlvtQCb9s">chasers</a>, insurance, treatments for diseases like diabetes, psoriasis, various kinds of cancers. Diarrhea. Constipation. Opiate induced constipation. Colonoscopies. Thankfully they seem to have stopped running the ads about the various obscene ways smoking can kill you (I quit! I quit! A long time ago!)</p>
<p>One thing you <i>never</i> see is an ad for the Democratic Party. </p>
<p>What they need imho is a campaign, to start, like Trivago's. A few years after that's had a chance to settle in, one of the threads of GEICO's great advertising about insurance. Whoever does their advertising, if they like Democrats, hire them. They really know what they're doing.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRmLcUIqCHI">Trivago</a>, a very new brand, has a simple position that they drive into your head over and over. It goes like this. </p>
<ul>
<li>Hotel? Trivago.</li>
</ul>
<p>Drill that in. Thinking about a hotel? Trivago. They want their word to be stored in your brain in same cell as the other word. </p>
<ul>
<li>Hotel? Trivago. Hotel? Trivago. Hotel? Trivago. Hotel? Trivago. Hotel? Trivago. Hotel? Trivago. Hotel? Trivago. Hotel? Trivago.</li>
</ul>
<p>As annoying as their ads are, and they are annoying, it works. The idea is planted. It hasn't yet gotten me to buy a hotel through Trivago. But at some point it probably will. (I use Kayak or Expedia.) </p>
<p>Another travel site, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RczJ5--p6yg">Booking.com</a> is trying for the same position. Their slogan goes like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Booking.com? Booking dot yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>It catches in the brain for some reason. </p>
<p>Well, here's what the Democratic Party should have planted in my brain. </p>
<ul>
<li>People? Democrats.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Democratic Party isn't about anything other than people. That means you. All different kinds of people, but mostly people like you. It works because it's the truth, and because it's what people want to feel. Democrats work for the people. Over and over. </p>
<ul>
<li>People? Democrats. People? Democrats. People? Democrats. People? Democrats. People? Democrats. People? Democrats. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bernie Sanders had the perfect Democratic Party <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nwRiuh1Cug">TV ad</a>. It reminds me how much I love America. It makes me cry every time I watch it. Too bad Volkswagen <a href="http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/volkswagen-looks-for-america-with-help-from-simon-garfunkel-in-this-poetic-cross-country-trip/">bought</a> the Simon and Garfunkel song. It would have been the perfect Democratic Party theme song. </p>
<p>Anyway. <i>People? Democrats</i> will take a few years of steady advertising. If they start now it might be in place in enough people's minds for the 2018 election. And that'll be the end of Republicans usurping the Democratic position as the party of the people. Which they used to <i>own. </i>And can have back. </p>

              I love threads like this. John Dickerson (CBS News) <a href="https://twitter.com/jdickerson/status/873525476282818561">asks</a> what would be a good book for a 15-year-old boy. Huge number of great suggestions.

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce">Paul Pierce</a> who is now a retired player and ABC commentator pointed out that to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/10/nba-finals-cleveland-cavaliers-golden-state-warriors-game-4">beat the Warriors</a>, the Cavs had to break about 15 all-time playoff records. But they live to play another day. And finally, despite my <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/09.html#a120618">pronouncement</a> otherwise, this has become at least an interesting series.
