                <h3><a href="http://tracking.feedpress.it/link/10732/5972697">Is Your Pain the Root of Porn Use?</a></h3>
                <p class="meta">Tuesday, 06 June 2017</p>
                <p>The real root of sexual sin ‚Äî <em>all</em> sexual sin ‚Äî is pride. Therefore, I argued recently that <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-real-root-of-sexual-sin">the most powerful weapon against sexual impurity</a> is humility. </p>

    <p>One reader wrote to me with an objection. He shared how for over two decades he had unsuccessfully battled an addiction to pornography. This sin destroyed his marriage, ruined friendships, and killed aspects of his ministry as a Christian. </p>

    <p>He had prayed countless times over those years for deliverance, but couldn‚Äôt get free until about a year ago when the Lord helped him address deep emotional pain and face certain fears. Now he experiences much greater freedom. Pain and fear, he said, were ‚Äúthe root issue[s] that drove me to use porn to medicate.‚Äù He believes his pride in hiding his sin contributed to his bondage, but his pain was at the root. </p>

    <p>I‚Äôm grateful this reader so humbly shared his past struggle and his current freedom (praise God!).  The issue he addresses is an important one, and I didn‚Äôt address it clearly in my article. While I believe deep emotional pain can play a significant role in our sexual sin, I don‚Äôt believe pain is ever at the root of sin.</p>

    <p id="pain-and-sexual-sin" data-linkify="true" class="bold">Pain and Sexual Sin</p>

    <p>What does the Bible have to say? I‚Äôm amazed that the Bible never references our past pain when directly addressing our sexual sin. Why might that be? </p>

    <p>Is it because we now experience whole new levels of evil and abuse that didn‚Äôt occur back then? Clearly not. Are we more sexually broken now? No. A survey of the sexual prohibitions in Leviticus 18‚Äì20 ‚Äî the sinful sexual practices of the inhabitants of Canaan (which are probably not exhaustive) ‚Äî reveal just how long sexual perversion and abuse have been part of the human experience. </p>

    <p>Is it because the Bible was written before we really understood human psychology and the effects of emotional pain? No. The ancients had different cultural and value blind spots than we have, but they were by no means psychologically ignorant. The Bible in particular is amazingly penetrating when it comes to the human psyche. The New Testament love ethic, which if embraced brings profound emotional healing and health, remains far more radical and progressive than twenty-first-century people are generally willing to be (Luke 6:27; 10:27; Romans 12:9‚Äì21; 1 Corinthians 13:4‚Äì7; 1 Peter 4:8). </p>

    <p>Then, why is it that when we read about the woman at the well in John 4, the adulteress in John 8, the incestuous man in 1 Corinthians 5, general human sexual immorality in Romans 1, or any other text where sexual sin is mentioned, the Bible doesn‚Äôt identify emotional pain in connection to our sexual sin?  It‚Äôs because the Bible doesn‚Äôt see pain as the root issue. It tells us that we are ‚Äútempted when [we are] lured and enticed by [our] own desire,‚Äù which ‚Äúwhen it has conceived gives birth to sin‚Äù (James 1:14‚Äì15).</p>

    <p id="god-knows-your-pain" data-linkify="true" class="bold">God Knows Your Pain</p>

    <p>But the Bible is anything but silent about our pain. The whole book is about the glory of God in our salvation from the psychologically destructive guilt of sin and deliverance from all emotionally wounding evil and futility. </p>

    <p>The world has no therapy to compare with the healing our damaged and diseased souls experience when we receive God‚Äôs complete forgiveness of our sins and extend the same forgiveness to those who‚Äôve sinned against us (Luke 11:4; Matthew 18:21‚Äì22; Romans 12:19‚Äì21). </p>

    <p>God is more in touch with our pain than we likely grasp or perhaps believe. Jesus came to endure all the same temptations we face and to suffer more rejection, abuse, and horror than we ever will. And he did this so he might not only be the perfect sacrifice for our sins (Hebrews 9:25‚Äì26), but also become the most sympathetic, compassionate, merciful high priest we could possibly have. In him, we draw near to God despite all our defilement, and receive all the grace we need for all our brokenness from his incomprehensively big, loving heart (Hebrews 4:14‚Äì16). </p>

    <p id="pride-manipulates-pain" data-linkify="true" class="bold">Pride Manipulates Pain</p>

    <p>So, what role does emotional pain play in our sexual sin? It makes us more vulnerable to our own sinful pride. </p>

    <p>In saying this, I am not blaming victims of sexual, physical, or emotional abuse for the damage others have inflicted upon them. The damage is real and horrible. I have dear loved ones who have suffered unspeakable things and consequently struggle in numerous ways, including sinful sexual issues. I tremble over the judgment that will befall the perpetrators if they do not repent and seek refuge in the only real refuge: Christ. </p>

    <p>But what is going on inside us when we try to medicate our pain through sinful sexual thoughts or behaviors? We are experiencing the terrible reality that our enemies are not only external abusers. Our worst enemy is within. This enemy seizes the vulnerability of our legitimate pain, which cries out for real healing and manipulates it as an opportunity to consume others for its own benefit. </p>

    <p>And the awful truth is this enemy is our own sin nature. I identify this sin as pride, because throughout church history pride has typically been considered the source sin, the deepest sin root for every sin fruit. </p>

    <p>And it‚Äôs our pride that wants to believe sinful sexual gratification will medicate our pain. And it‚Äôs not just sex. Pride wants to believe other sinful perversions of good things will also medicate. It moves us to medicate with overeating, anorexia, alcoholism, and workaholism. It moves us to try medicating with ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù obsessive pursuits, like academic or athletic achievement, fitness, others‚Äô approval, social status, parenting success, and ministry success. Pride even moves us to try medicating with medication ‚Äî the sinful use of prescription or illicit drugs.</p>

    <p id="address-pain-kill-pride" data-linkify="true" class="bold">Address Pain, Kill Pride</p>

    <p>This is why I say pride, not pain, is the root of sexual (and other kinds of) sin. Pain provides a vulnerable weakness and therefore an opportunity for sin. But it‚Äôs sinful pride that seizes that opportunity to pursue our selfish desires (James 1:14).</p>

    <p>There‚Äôs no question that pain can be a significant factor in our battles with sexual sin. Deep soul-wounds can make us vulnerable to particular sinful temptations, so to address sexual struggles we often must address pain-induced vulnerabilities.</p>

    <p>But the root of sin is pride, not pain. Pride perverts. When pain wants comfort, and we are drawn to seek comfort in sin, pride is manipulating our legitimate desire for healing into a selfish pursuit of consuming others. And if we capitulate and then experience conviction or are somehow exposed, it will quickly morph into self-pity and make this defense: ‚ÄúI did this because I am wounded.‚Äù But that‚Äôs not true. We feel pain because we‚Äôre wounded; we pursue sin because we‚Äôre prideful.</p>

    <p>We must address our pain with the healing God offers. But we must also be killing our pride. Which is why our most powerful weapon against sexual sin is <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-real-root-of-sexual-sin">humility</a>.</p>

            The Bible has a lot to say about money, and for good reason. Money, we find, has a uniquely powerful way of exposing our hearts and displaying our priorities. Ultimately, we see that it comes down to a matter of loyalty: ‚ÄúNo one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money‚Äù (Matthew 6:24).

                When I link to search queries I'm using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> now. I was using Google figuring that they'd be the most long-lived search engine -- the links would likely work years from now. But it all comes down to what "work" <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=work&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web">means</a>. Google is playing <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/30/strategyTax.html">strategy tax</a> games with search. I no longer consider it authoritative. It misses too many things that are important for reasons that have nothing to do with their value as a search result. I'm bettting that DuckDuckGo has a stronger philosophy and even if they were not to last as long as Google they're still worth supporting.

                An idea. I sent this to my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/danmactough?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Dan MacTough</a> who wrote the <a href="https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser">FeedParser</a> package for Node that I use in <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a>. "How about a package that compiles XML text into a JavaScript  object exactly as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse">JSON.parse</a> does." I got this idea from reading promotional material for the <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a> project. One of their concerns is that XML parsing is too hard. Okay, that's feedback. I think they're right. So let's make it as easy. Easy is good. Why not?

<p>How is it irrefutable? He ignores acts of terrorism where the perp is Christian. Only Muslim terrorism matters. But the Christian kind is more terrifying here in the US. We breed <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2017/05/man_accused_in_max_attack_cont.html">deplorable</a> Christians here by the thousands.  </p>
<p>You know where racist presidents take us, right? If you don't name it, you let it develop in the dark. </p>

                <h3><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a040652">Is Facebook broken?</a></h3>
                <p class="meta">Tuesday, 06 June 2017</p>
                <p>A really good <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/04/when-you-look-into-the-news-feed-the-news-feed-looks-into-you/">piece</a> in TechCrunch, you should read it if you care about social networks, how we got to where we are, and how stuck they are, and how weird it's going to get. The last part is left to your imagination in TechCrunch. But it's what I find most interesting.</p>
<p>I'm indirectly quoted in the TechCrunch story. They point to Gruber's <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/06/fuck_facebook">piece</a> entitled <i>Fuck Facebook,</i> and it extensively quotes a <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/31.html#a110526">piece</a> I wrote that explains why I can't/won't point to blog posts on Facebook. I followed up to <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/03.html#a010637">say</a> I continue to use FB and hope they fix the problem and turn FB into a fantastic blogging surface that I can cross-post to from my blog.</p>
<p>I wasn't kidding. I really have no use for FB as a blogging platform as long as they shun the web that gave them life. It was the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=primordial+soup&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web">primordial soup</a> they emerged from. Without it, 11-year-old Zuck would have had no way to experiment with social nets. But now Facebook so obviously tries to keep the web out, but my writing depends on the ability to integrate the writing of the web. It's like programming without the ability to factor replicated code into subroutines. <i>In FB blogging you're starting from scratch every time. </i>Yet Zuck uses Facebook to communicate with his users. His posts never have links and no titles, no styling. Just huge numbers of long paragraphs one after the other. That's probably one of the reasons I never read his posts. Maybe his thinking doesn't build on other people's ideas either? I've never met Zuck. Maybe that tells you something. Do you think the Beatles met Chuck Berry? Weird example I know. :shrug:</p>
<p>Should we let the news orgs off the hook? Of course not. They're even worse than Facebook. At least FB lets us post as equals to Zuck. And that's meant some voices have gained traction on FB without approval of Zuck and Company. Examples are numerous. But the NYT? You have to belong to a very exclusive club to be invited to post on their site. You have to know someone. And they have to like you. And that keeps out the truly good ideas. I know that when I read the NYT. I am welcome to read, and to pay, but my ideas aren't good enough to appear alongside the writers of the NYT. So they're even more of a silo than FB. </p>
<p>I still want the web. Look at the post I wrote yesterday about <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/05.html#a080612">RSS-in-JSON</a>. I spent a lot of time thinking about it, preparing, reading background material. How sterile it would have been if I could only <i>mention</i> the work I learned from instead of giving you, the reader, who I respect, a chance to read for yourself. Maybe you'd come to a different conclusion? You have to know, after all these <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/10/07/20YearsOfBlogging.html">years</a>, that that's totally OK with me.</p>
<p>I want the web and Facebook won't give it to me. So I think now Facebook has a huge self-imposed limit to growth, just like the journalists. Eventually I believe they will pay for it. Yet the conventional wisdom in tech is that Facebook won, they killed the goose that gave them the golden egg. I wouldn't bet on it. </p>

                <h3><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a050640">Old School really worked</a></h3>
                <p class="meta">Tuesday, 06 June 2017</p>
                <p>I have to say my new <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22old+school%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web">blogging platform</a> has made a huge difference.</p>
<p>All the techniques of 20 years ago come right back. I feel in a way like I'm writing in the "pages" of HotWired. I feel a confidence I haven't had in a long time. </p>
<p>It was the right thing to do. Often software only feels that way before you use it. The really good stuff feels that way even after you've settled in.</p>
<p>Now there are things that aren't hooked in. And the Facebook and Twitter metadata don't work properly in this model. I hope they see that and realize we could do better. I can't change their software, only mine. </p>
<p>Seems that's true of people too btw. If you want change and you're waiting for other people to give it to you, look for ways you can change, and that will automatically make them change. It's powerful, but it's the harder of the two ways. </p>

                Getting ready for a little trip, just a couple of days, want to be sure I can update my blog from my laptop. That's what this little test is for.

                I watched the first ten minutes of last night's NBA Finals <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/04/nba-finals-cleveland-cavaliers-golden-state-warriors-game-2">game</a> and switched it off. Too painful. For now Golden State is unbeatable. I'll watch the beginning of the next game to see if anything is different.

                <h3><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/05.html#a080612">The story of RSS-in-JSON</a></h3>
                <p class="meta">Monday, 05 June 2017</p>
                <p>A few years ago, in 2012, I tried an experiment, publishing RSS semantics using JSON syntax, to see what would happen, much like the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html">experiment</a> that got <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> started in 1997. I wanted to see if there was interest among developers for a JSON version of RSS. I put up a <a href="http://rssjs.org/">website</a>, with comments, and added a JSON feed to my blog (technically it was JSONP). Wired even asked me to write a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/09/rss-in-json-for-real/">piece</a> about it. </p>
<p>Not much happened with the feed, but the comments underneath the post were quite impressive, especially now, five years later. </p>
<p>Then my friends Brent Simmons and Manton Reece, two developers with a strong interest in syndication (Brent wrote <a href="http://inessential.com/category/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> and Manton is currently working on <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>) published a spec for a format they call <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a>. It was supported immediately by Brent's blog, <a href="http://inessential.com/feed.json">inessential.com</a>, and the Macintosh community central blog, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/json">Daring Fireball</a>. It was off to a strong start. </p>
<p>I had mixed feelings about this, and wrote it up in a <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/21/reEvanWilliamsAndJsonFeed.html">post</a> a couple of days after the format was announced. I was concerned about whether there was demand for JSON syntax among people who actually produce feeds and write software that consumes feeds. I understand how developers feel, but how many of them are responsible for the flow of RSS-based news? I was also concerned because they were creating new names for things that already existed in RSS 2.0. I had the same concern with Atom, many years ago. Why not start with the same names, and add to them where needed. </p>
<ul>
<li>Aside: I observed that <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2008/03/26/whyCantWeAllJustGetAlong.html#p7">even</a> though Islam, Christianity and Judaism are different religions, their holy books have many of the same stories, and the characters have the same names. If they can do it, presumably to allow some level of interop, why can't technology? It can, imho and must.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these ideas were expressed in my manifesto, <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/09/rulesForStandardsmakers.html">Rules for standards-makers</a>, which came out shortly before the release of Brent and Manton's spec (a coincidence, there was no connection, I wrote the piece in anticipation of a podcasting conference at Harvard in early May).</p>
<p>But there was interest in the JSON Feed format as evidenced by the long list of <a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/JSONFeed/issues">comments</a> on the GitHub site where it is being discussed. </p>
<p>So I thought about it, and while I was working on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22old+school%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web">Old School</a>, my new blogging platform, I decided to detour for a couple of days to review my RSS-generating code, and to add parallel code that generates a <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.json">JSON-syntax feed</a> with exactly the same semantics as the RSS version. I wrote that up <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/30.html#a110554">here</a>, on May 30. In that piece I promised to write more and to provide some technical details about how the format is constructed. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/rss-in-json/README.md">https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/rss-in-json</a></p>
<p>It took longer to write than I thought it would, probably because it's a very short document. I had able help from my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/awbjs?lang=en">Allen Wirfs-Brock</a>, who has a lot of experience editing technical specs, having worked on just that at Microsoft and Mozilla. </p>
<p>What do I hope happens? Well, whatever was meant to happen. :balloon:</p>
